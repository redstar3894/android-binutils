# .eh_frame with relocations to a removed (group) section did result to:
# error in tmpdir/eh-group.o(.eh_frame); no .eh_frame_hdr table will be created.
# The purpose of this test is to merge two .o files with -r and then link this
# merged file (containing a discarded R_X86_64_NONE relocation) to the final
# executable trying to create .eh_frame_hdr.  It needs a separate .exp file due
# to the requirement of two `ld' runs.

# Exclude non-CFI (such as ia64) targets.
